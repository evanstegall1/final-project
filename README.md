## Thunderstorm

This is my final project for PDM 2022. It includes the implementation of p5.js, tone.js, and physical computing via the Arduino Uno

### Graphics using p5.js
##### Rain
Used an array of blue lines with varying size and speed to make animation more realistic
User can toggle rain on/off with the click of a mouse
When the rain is running a sample is triggered
##### Clouds
Used an array of semi-transparent varying grey ellipses
Ellipses move at varying rates to show the atmospheric turmoil of a storm
##### Lightning
The event of lightning, triggered by any key, fills the screen with a breif semi-transparent white flash
Each flash occurs twice and triggers a sound event
